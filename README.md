# Fix10.bat

This is a batch file intended for power users to apply some registry and other small patches to Windows 10 to increase privacy and usability. If you run this script, it is advised to run it every time your system goes through a major Windows 10 update, as some settings might reset.

## Disclaimer

The batch file in question requires administrative privileges to run on a system and is intended to only be run on Windows 10. Regardless of conditions, the script is run at your own risk, and HandleSoft cannot be responsible for increased boot times (will likely happen) or, perhaps even worse, features removed from the system or the system refusing to function or start up properly, or any other adverse side effects. By running the batch file, you accept that you have read this disclaimer and understand its and the script's consequences.

## Notes on Windows 10 editions

Several of the modifications rely on registry settings, some of which are Group Policy settings. Due to Microsoft's will to restrict users, some of the changes might not work in some editions of Windows 10, most notably the Home and Pro editions. It is also impossible to guarantee the functionality of the changes in future upgrades.

## List of changes applied so far

* Enable seconds in the tray
* Show file extensions and hidden files
* Disable Data Collection Publishing Service
* Enables Legacy Boot Loader + F8 Safe Mode 
  * This might slow down booting by a few seconds, but it enables Advanced Boot Options, and I consider it a fair trade-off.
* Disable Fast Startup (!!!)
  * This might slow down booting by a few seconds too. It's related to the above, and makes sure your system actually shuts down instead of just pretending to. 

### Optional changes (must be enabled by editing the file)

The batch file has a configuration section at the beginning with a few options. These options allow the following:

* fix10dropbatchutils (0 disables (default), 1 enables)
  * Drops two files, xqacl.bat and xqgod.bat under System32, which add the xqacl and xqgod commands for the Run dialog and terminals. xqacl allows opening an elevated command line, while xqgod opens the All Tasks "god mode" window.
* fix10removemixed (0 disables (default), 1 enables) 
  * If enabled, sets the Holographic FirstRunSucceeded flag to 0. If the computer is restarted with this flag, Mixed Reality should be automatically uninstalled from the computer.
* fix10delcortana (0 disables (default), 1 enables) 
  * If enabled, the script will delete Cortana and its files from the computer. To reinstall it, you must disable this flag and reinstall the package manually through PowerShell.
* fix10disablesmartscreen (0 disables (default), 1 enables) 
  * If enabled, the script will disable SmartScreen. This might be a security issue, and is not recommended, if the computer will be actively used by non-power users.
* fix10installbash (0 disables (default), 1 enables) 
  * If enabled, the script will enable Developer Mode and initiate the installation of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The subsystem will not be installed if it is already detected.
